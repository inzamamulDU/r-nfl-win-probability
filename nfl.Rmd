The easiest way to get nflfastR is to install it from CRAN with:
install.packages("nflfastR")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("topfunky/gghighcontrast")
devtools::install_github("GuangchuangYu/ggimage") 
devtools::install_github("r-lib/scales")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/tidyverse")
install.packages("scale")
install.packages("ggimage")

Load libraries

```{r global-options, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)
```

```{r}
library(nflfastR)
library(tidyverse)
library(gghighcontrast)
library(scales)
library(ggimage)
library(ggplot2) 

```

Don't display numbers in scientific notation

```{r}
options(scipen = 9999)
```

Colors

```{r}
dayglo_orange = "#ff6700"
light_blue = "#0098ff"
red = "#ff0000"
grey = "#808080"
kiwi_green = "#8ee53f"
dark_olive_green = "#556b2f"
dark_raspberry = "#872657"
rich_black = "#010203"
```


```{r}
if (!dir.exists("data")) {
  dir.create("data")
}

load_data <- function(start_year, end_year, logos) {
  # For each year, load data
  data <- data.frame()
  for (year in seq(start_year, end_year, by = 1)) {
    # Download file to cache if not present
    url = str_interp(
      "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guga31bb/nflfastR-data/master/data/play_by_play_${year}.rds"
    )
    local_filename = str_interp("data/play_by_play_${year}.rds")
    if (!file.exists(local_filename)) {
      download.file(url, local_filename)
    }

    pbp_single_year <-
      readRDS(str_interp('data/play_by_play_${year}.rds'))
    data <- bind_rows(data, pbp_single_year)
  }

  data <-
    data %>% inner_join(logos, by = c("posteam" = "team_abbr"))

Be nice to the ESPN CDN by storing team logo images locally.
